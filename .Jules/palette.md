## 2026-05-17 - Missing Input Labels in Core Authentication and Dashboard Forms
**Learning:** Discovered a consistent pattern of missing `<label>` elements for form inputs in the Svelte routes (`login`, `dashboard`). This degrades accessibility for screen reader users and makes the UI less intuitive for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always ensure every form `<input>` has an associated `<label>` using the `id` and `for` attributes. For secondary actions like switching between login and registration, use buttons with clear descriptive text or ARIA roles rather than just separate buttons.
